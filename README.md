Live game server query, standlone library that provides multiple game queries for you. <br />
Based on [LGSL](https://github.com/tltneon/lgsl), thanks to tltneon.
<br />
<br />
This package is tested only on PHP 8.2, why? <br />
Because PHP 7.4 or lower are on end of life and PHP 8.0 is only security fixes.<br />
My recommendation is to use latest version, that is available at [PHP](https://php.net)
